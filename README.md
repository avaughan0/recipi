# recipi

This is my repo for my project to create a virtual assistant that can do the following:
1. take pictures of my recipes in my cookbooks
2. ingest recipes from pictures of my cookbooks using OCR
3. store and retrieve recipes on command
4. be able to take voice commands and respond with voice output
